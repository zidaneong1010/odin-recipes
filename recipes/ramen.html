        I'm not sure why they decided to use such a low quality picture, but hey, the ramen doesn't look too half bad tbh.

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <p> Congrats! Now that you got everything, it's time for the magic!</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 275 degrees </li>
                <li> Place black fungus in a large bowl and fill with water. </li>
                <li> Combine mirin, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 green onion bulbs, chopped onion, and garlic in an oven-safe pot over high heat. Bring to a boil</li>
                <li> Place pork belly skin-side down on a flat work surface. Roll up lengthwise and wrap with butcher's twine. Place pork belly in the pot with the mirin mixture and partially cover with a lid. </li>     
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until pork is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 4 hours. </li>     
                <li> Bring a separate pot of water to a boil over high heat. Gently place eggs in the pot and cook until yolks are barely set, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl filled with ice water. Let sit, about 1 minute. Remove from water and peel eggs.</li>     
                <li> Place eggs in a container with 1 cup water, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Dampen a paper towel in the mixture and use it to cover the container. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. </li>     
                <li> Drain the fungus and add to the liquid in the pot with the pork belly. Cover with a lid and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight. </li>     
                <li> Skim fungus from the top of the pork belly mixture and place in a pot with 8 cups water; fungus should be covered in pork belly fat. Add 1/4 cup soy sauce and miso paste. Bring to a boil. </li>     
                <li> Remove skin from the pork belly using a knife. Chop the meat into pieces of desired thickness. Cut eggs in half lengthwise. </li>     
                <li> Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes. Drain. </li>
                <li> Place 4 slices of nori diagonally in the corner of each bowl. Place noodles on top; arrange 2 egg halves and a few pork belly slices in separate corners. Cover with black fungus, top with green onions, and pour in broth. Top each bowl with a few slices of naruto. Let sit, about 3 minutes, before serving.</li>
            </ol>
