        This delicious Island-Style Fried Rice recipe was created by a user named "NovelApproach" from 
        the website <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/270635/sushi-bake/"> All Recipes</a>.
        They say: Savory and satisfying, this easy-to-make dish is a local favorite in Hawaii. This is the only dish I
        bring to parties anymore. Even at a smaller gathering, I get to take home a clean baking dish at the
        end of the night. Like most casseroles, this dish is very forgiving, so don't sweat it if you can't 
        find an ingredient or aren't sure about the quantities.

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <p> 
            Congrats! Now that you got everything, it's time for the magic! Luckily when making sushi bake,
            nothing has to be precise or accurate as sushi bake is naturally a loveable mess (just like the fried 
            rice we made)! Here we go:
        </p>
            <ol>

                <li>
                    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                </li>

                <li> 
                    Soak shiitake mushrooms in hot water until soft, 5 to 10 minutes.
                </li>

                <li> 
                    Meanwhile, lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan or glass baking dish. Spread rice in 
                    the prepared pan; sprinkle furikake evenly over the top.           
                 </li>

                 <li> 
                    Drain mushrooms and squeeze out excess water. Mix mushrooms, imitation crabmeat, mayonnaise, sour cream, 
                    tobiko, and kamaboko in a large bowl. Spread over the furikake.      
                 </li>

                 <li> 
                    Broil in the preheated oven until the top is lightly browned, about 15 minutes. 
                    Slice into 24 portions and serve in the pan. Spoon a generous mound onto a sheet of seaweed, 
                    wrap loosely, and consume immediately.      
                 </li>
                
            </ol>
